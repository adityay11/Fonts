Athena VKF is a a modern-traditional greek font, inspired by the old (about 1950-1970) Greek movie theater.
It is the second font in VKF typeface with a great honor in our Greek movie memories designed by Vasilis Kanaris.
Exploring and study this forgotten heritage and adapt it
its special style in modern media and communication tools. VKF version supports Greek letters and English.
Includes lowercase, uppercase letters and symbols. Athena VKF is a very special font and I suggest her
for unique logotypes, product designs, special campaigns and advertisment.
